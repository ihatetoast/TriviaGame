# Trivia Game with Timed Questions

To Do (logic):
* (_X_) make the card with the id slots for question and possible answers
* (_X_) create an array of ~~arrays~~ objs.
* (_X_) fill "card" of the question and possible answers
* ~~(__) card loads right answer in different place every time (?)~~
* (_X_) load cards to DOM in intervals and let them stay up a certain length of * time
* (_X_) only allow one answer. onclick or abcd and onkeyup
* (_X_) submit triggers right or wrong answer response
* (_X_) right answer responses show a huzzah. 
* (_X_) timing out triggers time's up / wrong answer response
* (_X_) wrong answer response and time out response shows correct answer and * moves on
* (_X_) next card appears (as in new question and answers loaded)
* (__) game over when last card appears
* (__) total tally shown. 
* (__) restart if user presses restart game. 
* (__) audio very last
